            <h2>Albert Einstein's Story</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, to a middle-class Jewish family. He struggled as a child due to his slower speech development, leading some to believe he had a learning disability. However, his curiosity about the world was evident early on, especially when he was given a compass at age five. Einsteinâ€™s fascination with how invisible forces moved the needle laid the foundation for his lifelong passion for understanding the universe.
            As a young man, Einstein faced setbacks; he failed to secure a teaching position after graduating. He eventually worked at a patent office, where he developed his groundbreaking theories in his spare time. In 1905, he published four papers that revolutionized physics, introducing the famous equation . He won the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. Later in life, Einstein became a vocal advocate for peace and civil rights. He passed away in 1955 but remains one of the most iconic figures in science.</p>
