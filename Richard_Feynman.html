            <h2>About Richard Feynman's Story</h2>
            <p>Richard Feynman, born in 1918 in Queens, New York, was a child prodigy with a knack for problem-solving. He studied physics at MIT and Princeton, contributing to the Manhattan Project during World War II. Feynman’s charisma and humor made him a beloved figure in science.
                Known for his work in quantum electrodynamics, Feynman’s contributions earned him a Nobel Prize in 1965. He was also an exceptional teacher, famous for his Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman’s playful side is evident in his hobbies, which included playing the bongo drums and cracking safes. He passed away in 1988 but left behind a legacy of curiosity and creativity.</p>
