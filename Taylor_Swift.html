She sang at local events, including a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at age 11. She began writing songs at age 12 and learned to play guitar with the help of a computer repairman. At age 14, Swift signed with Sony/ATV as a songwriter. She performed original songs at an RCA Records showcase and was given an artist development deal. Swift has won 11 Grammys and been nominated for 42. In 2024, she became the first artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year four times.
