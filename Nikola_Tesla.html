            <h2>About Nikola Tesla's Story</h2>
            <p>Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in what is now Croatia, Nikola Tesla displayed extraordinary intellect from a young age. He studied engineering and physics before moving to the United States, where he worked briefly for Thomas Edison. Teslaâ€™s visionary ideas about electricity, particularly alternating current (AC), revolutionized the field.
                Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled with business and financial issues. He envisioned futuristic technologies like wireless communication and renewable energy but was often overshadowed by others. Tesla died alone in 1943, but his contributions have since been recognized as transformative.
