            <h2>About Beyonce's Story</h2>
            <p>Born on September 4, 1981 in Houston, Texas to Tina and Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé began performing in talent contests at age seven. Her father managed her group, and her mother owned a hair salon. Beyoncé formed the group in 1990 with childhood friends, originally calling it Girl's Tyme. The group's lineup changed several times, but eventually included Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. Destiny's Child became one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Beyoncé released her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The album featured the hit single "Crazy in Love", which featured Jay-Z. Beyoncé went on to have several number-one solo albums, including B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). Beyoncé holds the record for most Grammy wins ever by a female artist with 32.</p>
