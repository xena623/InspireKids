            <h2>About Marie Curie's Story</h2>
            <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867. She grew up in a family passionate about education, but due to political oppression, women were barred from attending university in her homeland. Undeterred, Curie moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where she excelled in physics and mathematics despite facing significant financial difficulties.
                Curie, along with her husband Pierre, discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium (named after Poland) and radium. Her relentless work earned her two Nobel Prizes—one in Physics (1903) and another in Chemistry (1911). Tragically, her exposure to radiation eventually caused her death in 1934. Her legacy lives on through her pioneering work in radioactivity and her inspiration as a woman who broke barriers in science.</p>
