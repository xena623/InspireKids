            <h2>About Lionel Messi's Story</h2>
            <p>Born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina, Messi began playing soccer as a child and joined Newell's Old Boys at age 9. At age 13, Messi moved to Barcelona, Spain with his family after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his growth hormone treatment. Messi made his first-team debut for FC Barcelona at age 16 in a friendly match. Messi played for Barcelona for 17 years, winning 10 La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and seven Copa del Rey trophies. He became the all-time leading scorer in La Liga with 474 goals. Messi helped Argentina win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. He also won an Olympic gold medal with Argentina in 2008.</p>
