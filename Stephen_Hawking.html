            <h2>About Stephen Hawking's Story</h2>
            <p>Stephen Hawking was born in 1942 in Oxford, England, Stephen Hawking showed an early interest in science and the universe. While studying at Cambridge University, he was diagnosed with ALS, a neurodegenerative disease, at the age of 21. Doctors gave him only a few years to live, but Hawking defied all odds, surviving for decades and continuing his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics.
                Hawking’s research focused on black holes and the origins of the universe. He introduced concepts like Hawking radiation, which suggested that black holes emit particles. Despite being almost entirely paralyzed, he communicated using a computer-assisted voice and authored best-selling books like A Brief History of Time. Hawking’s resilience and humor inspired millions, and he passed away in 2018, leaving an indelible mark on science.
