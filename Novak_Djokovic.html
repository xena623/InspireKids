            <h2>About Novak Djokovic's Story</h2>
            <p>Born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia) in 1987, Djokovic began playing tennis at age four after his father gave him a mini-racket and ball. He quickly became Europe's top-ranked 14-and-under player and turned professional in 2003. Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam singles titles, a record for men's tennis. He won his first Grand Slam at the 2008 Australian Open, becoming the first Serbian man to do so. In 2016, he became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles at once. Djokovic is the founder of the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which supports children from disadvantaged communities. In 2015, he was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.
