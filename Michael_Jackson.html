            <h2>About Michael Jackson's Story</h2>
            <p>Born in Gary, Indiana, Jackson began performing at age 6 with his brothers in the Jackson 5. The group signed with Motown Records in 1969 and became stars with several hit songs. Jackson launched his solo career in the late 1970s with his first album, Off the Wall, which was the best-selling album of 1979. His 1982 album Thriller is one of the best-selling albums in history. Jackson's influence extended beyond music to include dance, concert touring, video presentation, and music production. He popularized street dance moves like the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson's career was rewarded with 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 6 Brit Awards, 5 Billboard Music Awards and 24 American Music Awards.</p>
