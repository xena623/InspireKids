            <h2>About Galileo Galilei Story</h2>
            <p>Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564, Galileo initially studied medicine but found his true passion in mathematics and physics. His improvements to the telescope allowed him to make groundbreaking astronomical observations, including the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus, which supported the heliocentric model of the solar system.
                Galileo’s discoveries challenged the Church’s geocentric view, leading to his trial for heresy. Forced to recant his views, he spent his later years under house arrest but continued his scientific work. Galileo’s courage in the face of opposition earned him the title “Father of Modern Science.” He died in 1642.</p>
