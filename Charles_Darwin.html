            <h2>About Charles Darwin's Story</h2>
            <p>Charles Darwin was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England. Initially studying medicine, he found his true calling in natural history. At 22, Darwin joined the HMS Beagle expedition, where he observed diverse species and ecosystems. These experiences led to his theory of evolution by natural selection, outlined in On the Origin of Species (1859).
                Darwin’s ideas faced significant backlash but fundamentally changed biology and our understanding of life’s diversity. He spent his later years in Kent, England, conducting experiments and writing. He died in 1882 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
