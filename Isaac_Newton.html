            <h2>About Isaac Newton's Story</h2>
            <p>Isaac Newton was born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England. He was a premature baby and was not expected to survive. Raised by his grandmother after his mother remarried, Newton grew up as a solitary and curious child. At Cambridge University, he flourished, despite the institution being closed during the plague years.
                During this time, Newton developed his theories of calculus, optics, and gravity. The famous story of the falling apple, while partly mythologized, reflects his interest in understanding natural forces. He published his ideas in Principia Mathematica, a work that laid the foundation for modern physics. Newtonâ€™s later life saw him delve into alchemy and biblical studies, and he served as Warden of the Royal Mint. He died in 1727, but his work remains fundamental to science.</p>
