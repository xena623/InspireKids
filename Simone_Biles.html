            <h2>About Simone Biles's Story</h2>
            <p>Simone Biles, born in Ohio, faced challenges from her parents' struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction. After being adopted by her father, Ron Biles, and his second wife, Nellie, she began a gymnastics training program at Bannon's Gymnastix in Houston. Despite her ADHD diagnosis, she was prescribed Ritalin to help her focus on tasks. Biles made her junior national debut at the 2011 American Classic, placing third in the all-around competition and first in the vault. At 14, she left public school to homeschool and competed at the 2012 U.S. Classic, winning gold medals in all-around, vault, balance beam, and floor exercise. At 15, she was too young to compete for the 2012 Olympic team. Biles set a new standard in gymnastics, excelling in jump height, speed, and landing security. In October 2023, she won her 21st world championship gold medal at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, becoming the most decorated gymnast in the combined history of the Olympics and world championships.
